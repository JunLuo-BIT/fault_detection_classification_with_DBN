# fault_detection_classification_with_DBN

This project is for detection and classification of faults occured in transmission line system using deep belief network.

Proposed solution:
The DBN based solution is till now not done for fault detection of 3 phasse transmission lines. The solution documentation is available in the folder as "SolutionDocumentation.docx". Please read the document for better understanding of the work.

Required matlab package:
1) Deep Neural Network
2) Simulink : Simscape - Power systems

Procedure:
Run the main.m file to train the model and it will open the simulink model for the power transmission line model developed usinng simulink- power system simscape
Chage the fault types of system using block 'three phase fault'. Run the simulation, it will result the Fault class.
